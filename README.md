Open world medieval city Builder, leveling, combat, exploring, crafting game.
The player starts with nothing and has to go from rags to riches. Start off doing everything himself (gathering supplies, crafting, building). After generating wealth through resources and trade with other settlements, one can hire npc to do work for them. This truly means that one starts with nothing, and can grow to become a ruler.

- Craft buildings and items
- Store items in inventories, houses or chests
- Leveling system (Crafting, Onehand, Twohand, Ranged, Woodcutting, Mining, Charisma, Influence, Foraging, Hunting, Agility, Trade)
- Combat against human npc's, monsters and wild animals
- Autogenerated map with resources, trees, plants, towns, dungeons, caves and more
- Camera functionality (Rotating, moving, lock on to player)
- UI (Inventory, crafting, progressbar, healthbar, hungerbar, thirstbar, toolsbar, armorbar, influenceoverview (ability to see which NPC's are hired and the trust they have for their boss)
- Ingame economy (maybe cryptocurreny support). NPC's will trade with eachother, build buildings and do other stuff with the resources.
- NPC hiring and influence system (A system where the main player can hire other npcs to do work for them. This can be fighting in their army, work the field to gain food, or gather other resources for the main player. The NPC's have needs too: money, food, appreciation which will impact how they see their lord)
