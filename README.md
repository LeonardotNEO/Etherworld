# Unity-Game
Medieva City Builder Game.
The player starts with nothing and has to go from rags to riches. Start off doing everything himself (gathering supplies, crafting, building). After generating wealth through resources and trade with other settlements, one can hire npc to do work for them. This truly means that one starts with nothing, and can grow to become a ruler. 

- Start with nothing (gather resources, hunt animals, build shelter, craft items, armor, weapons)
- Level up crafting abilities, combat abilities to be more effective.
- Sell items and resources to local villages.
- Use money to generate new wealth through building more expensive buildings, crafting more expensive items, hiring other npc to do work for oneself.
- Build armies of npc with wealth and use influence to conquer other villages
